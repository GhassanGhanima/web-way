# Production Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures that all necessary steps are completed before deploying the accessibility tool to production.

## Security Hardening

- [ ] Run security vulnerability scan using OWASP ZAP
- [ ] Verify all npm dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Confirm rate limiting is correctly configured for all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify JWT secret is properly set in production environment
- [ ] Ensure CORS settings are restrictive and properly configured
- [ ] Audit authentication flows for security issues
- [ ] Ensure production database is properly secured
- [ ] Implement input validation for all user-provided data
- [ ] Verify that sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS configuration and ensure proper certificates are installed
- [ ] Implement HTTP security headers (already configured via Helmet)
- [ ] Confirm proper access controls and role-based permissions
- [ ] Set up IP restriction for admin endpoints if applicable

## Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Create production Kubernetes or server infrastructure
- [ ] Set up load balancing for API servers
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets and widget delivery
- [ ] Set up high-availability database with proper replication
- [ ] Configure Redis for caching and session management
- [ ] Set up separate staging environment that mirrors production
- [ ] Prepare database backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Document infrastructure architecture

## Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Configure error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Implement structured logging for all services
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring for all services
- [ ] Create dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Document common operational procedures

## Deployment Process

- [ ] Create production environment configuration
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- [ ] Set up database migration process
- [ ] Document rollback procedures in case of deployment failures
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy
- [ ] Set up staging environment for pre-production testing
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Configure automated testing in deployment pipeline

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Run load tests to ensure system can handle expected traffic
- [ ] Optimize database queries and add necessary indexes
- [ ] Configure proper caching strategies
- [ ] Minimize API response sizes
- [ ] Optimize widget loading performance
- [ ] Set up CDN properly for global distribution
- [ ] Implement asset optimization (minification, compression)
- [ ] Configure proper HTTP caching headers

## Final Verification

- [ ] Conduct complete system test in staging environment
- [ ] Verify all core functionality works as expected
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify subscription and payment processes
- [ ] Test widget functionality on various browsers and devices
- [ ] Check analytics collection and reporting
- [ ] Perform accessibility testing on the admin portal
- [ ] Review all documentation for accuracy
