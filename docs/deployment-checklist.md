This checklist helps ensure successful deployment of the Accessibility Tool API to production environments.

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are correctly set in production
- [ ] Ensure sensitive values are stored securely
- [ ] Confirm database connection details are correct
- [ ] Check Redis connection settings
- [ ] Validate external service credentials (Stripe, Google OAuth, etc.)

### Database Preparation
- [ ] Create backup of existing database (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify database migrations are ready to run
- [ ] Check for any breaking schema changes

### Security Review
- [ ] Run security scanning tools against the codebase
- [ ] Verify JWT secrets are strong and secure
- [ ] Confirm rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] Check CORS settings are restrictive and appropriate
- [ ] Ensure logging doesn't capture sensitive information

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Verify caching is properly configured
- [ ] Check database indexes are optimized
- [ ] Ensure assets are compressed and optimized
- [ ] Review database query performance

### Testing
- [ ] Complete all unit and integration tests
- [ ] Verify end-to-end tests pass
- [ ] Complete load/stress testing
- [ ] Perform manual testing of critical paths

## Deployment Process

### Preparation
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment schedule
- [ ] Schedule deployment during low-traffic period (if possible)
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Update deployment documentation (if needed)

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Pull latest production image
- [ ] Deploy to infrastructure using Docker Compose
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Verify application health checks pass
- [ ] Check application logs for any errors
- [ ] Monitor application startup

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are functioning correctly
- [ ] Check authentication flows work as expected
- [ ] Test subscription and payment processes
- [ ] Verify CDN functionality is working
- [ ] Confirm analytics data is being collected properly
- [ ] Test accessibility script loading

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Verify log aggregation is working
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- [ ] Update API documentation if needed
- [ ] Document any deployment issues and solutions
- [ ] Update runbooks with new information
- [ ] Share deployment results with team

### Clean-up
- [ ] Remove old Docker images
- [ ] Archive logs from previous version
- [ ] Update backup schedules if needed

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Restore previous Docker image version:
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop
   docker-compose rm -f app
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. If database issues:
   ```bash
   # Revert last migration
   docker-compose exec app npm run migration:revert
   ```

3. If data corruption occurred, restore from backup:
   ```bash
   # Database restore command depends on your setup
   pg_restore -U postgres -d accessibility_tool < backup.sql
   ```
