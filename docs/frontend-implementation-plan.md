# Frontend Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

After successfully implementing the comprehensive backend API for our accessibility tool, the next step is to develop a frontend admin dashboard. This dashboard will provide a user-friendly interface for managing all aspects of the platform.

## Technology Stack

For the frontend admin dashboard, we recommend using:

- **React** or **Vue.js** as the core framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Query** / **Vue Query** for data fetching and caching
- **Redux** / **Pinia** for state management (if needed)
- **React Router** / **Vue Router** for routing
- **Vitest** / **Jest** for testing
- **Vite** for build tooling

## Core Features

The frontend dashboard should include these key features:

1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - Login/registration screens
   - User profile management
   - Role-based access control UI
   - Password reset workflow

2. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Key metrics and KPIs
   - Recent activity feed
   - System status indicators
   - Quick action buttons

3. **User Administration**
   - User listing with filtering and search
   - User details and history view
   - User editing and role assignment
   - Bulk user operations

4. **Subscription Management**
   - Plan configuration interface
   - Subscription status overview
   - Subscription creation and modification
   - Payment history and invoicing

5. **Integration Management**
   - Integration listing and details
   - Domain verification workflow
   - Configuration interface
   - Usage statistics per integration

6. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Custom report builder
   - Export functionality
   - Scheduled report management

7. **CDN & Script Management**
   - Script version management
   - Script deployment interface
   - Performance monitoring
   - Asset management

8. **System Configuration**
   - Global settings interface
   - Email template management
   - Internationalization settings
   - Security configuration

## Implementation Approach

We recommend a phased approach to frontend development:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Authentication
- Set up project structure and build pipeline
- Implement authentication flows
- Create basic layout and navigation
- Develop user profile management

### Phase 2: User & Subscription Management
- Implement user administration interfaces
- Create subscription management screens
- Develop payment processing workflows
- Implement invoicing and receipt generation

### Phase 3: Integration & Analytics
- Build integration management screens
- Develop domain verification workflow
- Create analytics dashboards
- Implement report generation and export

### Phase 4: System Administration
- Develop system configuration interfaces
- Create CDN management tools
- Implement health monitoring dashboards
- Build audit logging and activity tracking

## UI/UX Considerations

For optimal user experience:

- Implement responsive design for all screens
- Use a consistent color scheme aligned with brand identity
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Create intuitive navigation with breadcrumbs
- Design for progressive disclosure of complex features
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Provide contextual help and tooltips

## API Integration

The frontend will communicate with our existing API:

- Use typed API clients generated from OpenAPI/Swagger
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Cache appropriate responses to minimize API calls
- Implement real-time updates where appropriate (WebSockets)

## Testing Strategy

Our testing approach should include:

- Unit tests for component functionality
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing for large datasets

## Deployment Configuration

For frontend deployment:

- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Configure CDN for static assets
- Set up environment-specific configuration
- Implement feature flags for phased rollouts
- Configure monitoring and error tracking
- Set up performance analytics

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the frontend admin dashboard:

1. Create a new repository for the frontend code
2. Set up the basic project structure and build tools
3. Configure authentication against the existing API
4. Implement the basic layout and navigation
5. Begin developing feature modules in priority order
